description: "This project explores the ecological and morphological diversity of palm species using the PalmTraits 1.0 dataset, a comprehensive collection of trait data for 2,539 palm species curated by Kissling et al. (2019). By leveraging data visualization techniques in R with ggplot2 and related packages, we aim to uncover patterns and insights about trait variation across species, growth forms, and biogeographical regions."
