We have chosen this dataset as it exhibits some strong combination of biological significance, trait diversity, and visual capability. Its mix of categorical and continuous traits across thousands of species provides a meaningful opportunity to explore ecological patterns using effective data visualization. Additionally, its structure is well-suited to address research questions involving trait co-occurrence and plant strategy trade-offs—making it an ideal choice."

    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nApproach for question 1\nTraits related to reproduction (fruit size and visibility) are expected to show moderate to low variation, high variation for structural growth traits, and palms with larger or more conspicuous fruits will tend to be taller, potentially due to selective pressure for enhanced seed dispersal.\nFor trait variability assessment we will create visual summaries with ridge plots for numeric traits and bar plots for categorical traits. To visualize the structural form of palm trees and how they are related to their fruit size and visibility, we will be using violin plots to visualize the distribution of maximum stem height (max_stem_height_m) across categories of fruit size and color conspicuousness. The conspicuousness variable represents how visually noticeable a fruit. Including it helps explore whether more visually striking fruits are associated with taller trees that may rely on long-distance seed dispersal. This will help us to examine the independent variables like fruit traits related to dependent variables like maximum stem height. Here the structural form is treated as the outcome variable, while fruit traits are predictors in our visual analysis.\nFirstly, we start with filtering and cleaning the PlamTrait dataset, focus on key variables max_stem_height_m, fruit_size_categorical, and conspicuousness. We will remove any records with missing values and ensure categorical values are consistent.\nThe violin plot will display fruit_size_categorical on the x-axis and max_stem_height_m on the y-axis. We will fill the violins by the conspicuousness variable to add a second layer of categorical comparison. This will allow us to identify how palm height distributions differ across combinations of fruit size and visibility traits.\nBy using violin plots, we can observe the median heights and also the variability in height within each category. This design results in four combinations. We’ll ensure clarity in the plot by either separating violins with facetting or introducing one variable at a time This approach helps us in visualizing whether taller palms are more likely to produce larger or more conspicuous fruits, and helps reveal potential evolutionary or ecological strategies linked to display and dispersal.\n\n\nApproach for question 2\nClimbing palms are expected to exhibit fewer spine traits due to structural support from host plants, which may reduce herbivore exposure and the need for physical defenses.\nFor the second question we are using heatmap to visualize combination of spine traits and growth forms. This allows us to investiage defensive traits such as spines (armature) co-occur with certain growth habits (climbing vs non-climbing). The approach is ideal for categorical co-occurrence data.\nWe begin with filtering and cleaning of the PlamTrait dataset thereby retaining only the relevant variables that is climbing, leaves_armed, and stem_armed. Any missing or ambiguous entries will be excluded. We will standardize the categorical values for consistency (armed vs unarmed) and create a new variable representing each unique trait combination such as both armed, leaf only, stem only, unarmed.\nWe will then group the data by climbing status and the combination variable. Using dplyr, we’ll calculate the count of palm species in each category combination.\n\nThe Heatmap will have “climbing” on one axis and the “spine combination categories” on the other. The fill color of each cell will reflect the “frequency or relative proportion of species” within that category pairing. We then annotate the tiles with exact counts to show visual interpretation better.\n\nHeat map visualization will help us identify whether climbing palms are more or less likely to exhibit defensive traits compared to erect palms. The heatmap’s clear structure makes it easy to detect trait co-occurrence patterns and generate hypotheses about the evolutionary or functional relationships between growth form and physical defenses."

We apply ridge plots to explore how palm height is distributed across different fruit size categories and levels of fruit conspicuousness. These plots help reveal whether there are noticeable differences in height between groups. In addition, we use a violin plot that combines both fruit size and conspicuousness, providing a more detailed view of how these two reproductive traits together relate to palm height. Visualizations allow us to identify potential patterns and ecological relationships between structural and reproductive traits in palms."

This ensures that our analysis is based on clean, complete data. The three variables selected for this analysis—palm height, fruit size, and fruit conspicuousness—allow us to examine how reproductive traits may be associated with structural form.\nFor visual exploration, we use ridge plots to compare the height distributions across different fruit size and conspicuousness groups. These plots provide an intuitive way to observe whether taller palms tend to produce larger or more visible fruits. We also create a violin plot that combines fruit size and conspicuousness to examine how these traits interact with palm height. The violin plot provides additional insight into the distribution and variability of height within each trait combination."

In the first ridge plot, we observe that palms with large fruits tend to have greater stem heights compared to those with small fruits. The overall height distribution for large-fruited palms extends further, suggesting that larger fruits are more common in taller species.\nA similar pattern is visible in the second ridge plot, which focuses on fruit conspicuousness. Palms with conspicuous (bright and easily visible) fruits generally show higher stem heights than those with cryptic (dull) fruits. This indicates that palms producing more visible fruits may also be taller, possibly to improve fruit visibility for animal seed disperses.\nThe violin plot, which combines both fruit size and conspicuousness, provides additional insight into how these traits interact with palm height. The tallest palms in the dataset tend to belong to the group with large, conspicuous fruits. This group not only shows greater median heights but also higher variability in stem height, compared to palms with small or cryptic fruits.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe results of our visual analysis reveal clear patterns suggesting that fruit traits and palm height are not independent but may be ecologically linked. The ridge plots show that palms with large fruits generally grow taller than those with small fruits. A similar pattern is observed for fruit conspicuousness, where palms producing conspicuous (bright, visible) fruits also tend to have greater stem heights compared to those with cryptic (dull) fruits. These trends support the idea that taller palms may invest in larger or more visible fruits as a reproductive strategy to enhance seed dispersal.\nThe violin plot further strengthens this interpretation by combining both fruit size and conspicuousness in a single visualization. It clearly shows that palms with large, conspicuous fruits have the tallest median stem heights and the widest distribution of heights. In contrast, palms with small or cryptic fruits tend to be shorter on average. This suggests that reproductive and structural traits in palms may evolve together to maximize the chances of successful seed dispersal, particularly in taller species."

We use the growth_form variable such as climbing, erect, mixed and two binary defense variables from the PalmTraits dataset, leaves_armed and stem_armed. We combine these into a single spine trait combination like both armed, leaf only, stem only, unarmed and visualize their co-occurrence using a heatmap.

    "text": "Visual Outcomes\nThe heatmap provides a clear visual summary of how defense traits co-occur with different growth forms in palms. Among climbing palms, the most common defense strategy is having spines on both leaves and stems, representing the majority of species in this growth form. In contrast, erect palms are most frequently armed only on the stem, with a much smaller proportion having spines on both leaves and stems. The mixed growth form group shows more balanced proportions across spine trait combinations but includes fewer species overall. These patterns suggest that climbing palms may rely on strong physical defenses across multiple parts of the plant, while erect palms may prioritize stem defenses, possibly reflecting differences in their ecological exposure and defense needs. Some spine and growth form combinations are rare or nearly absent. For example, almost no erect palms have both leaf and stem spines, and “Leaf Only” defence is uncommon in all growth forms."

The mixed growth form palms show no clear defense pattern, but species counts are low. These patterns suggest that defense traits in palms are shaped by their growth form and ecological pressures.\n\nFuture Work\nFuture research could explore how the relationship between growth form and defense traits varies across different geographical regions and ecological environments. By integrating spatial data, such as the native range or habitat type of each species, we can investigate whether certain defense strategies are more common in specific continents, climates, or ecosystems."
