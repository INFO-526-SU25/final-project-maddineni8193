The dataset featured in March 18, 2025 TidyTuesday release and was originally published in the journel “PalmTraits 1.0, a species-level functional trait database of palms worldwide” by Kissling, W.D., Balslev, H., Baker, W.J. et al (2019). The dataset contains 2557 rows and 29 columns. The dataset comes with a wide range of variables, the variables we will be using to analyse are :\n\n\n\nKey Variables to be used in this project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nClass\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmax_stem_height_m\nnumeric\nMaximum stem height in meters\n\n\nfruit_size_categorical\ncharacter\nFruit size category: small (&lt;4cm) or large (≥4cm)\n\n\nconspicuousness\ncharacter\nFruit visibility: conspicuous (bright) or cryptic (dull)\n\n\nclimbing\ncharacter\nGrowth habit: climbing or non-climbing\n\n\nleaves_armed\ncharacter\nPresence of spines on leaves\n\n\nstem_armed\ncharacter\nPresence of spines on stem\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportance of choosing the dataset\nThe database with its wide variety variables allows some rich comparative analysis and explanations. We have chosen this dataset as it exhibits some strong combination of biological significance, trait diversity, and visual capability. Its mix of categorical and continuous traits across thousands of species provides a meaningful opportunity to explore ecological patterns using effective data visualization. Additionally, its structure is well-suited to address research questions involving trait co-occurrence and plant strategy trade-offs—making it an ideal choice."

    "section": "Analysis plan",
    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nApproach for question 1\nTo visualize the structural form of palm trees and how they are related to their fruit size and visibility, we will be using violin plots to visualize the distribution of maximum stem height (max_stem_height_m) across categories of fruit size and color conspicuousness. The conspicuousness variable represents how visually noticeable a fruit is to potential animal dispersers. Including it helps explore whether more visually striking fruits are associated with taller trees that may rely on long-distance seed dispersal. This will help us to examine the independent variables like fruit traits related to dependent variables like maximum stem height. Here the structural form is treated as the outcome variable, while fruit traits are predictors in our visual analysis.\nFirstly, we start with filtering and cleaning the PlamTrait dataset, focus on key variables max_stem_height_m, fruit_size_categorical, and conspicuousness. We will remove any records with missing values and ensure categorical values are consistent.\nThe violin plot will display fruit_size_categorical on the x-axis and max_stem_height_m on the y-axis. We will fill the violins by the conspicuousness variable to add a second layer of categorical comparison. This will allow us to identify how palm height distributions differ across combinations of fruit size and visibility traits.\nBy using violin plots, we can observe the median heights and also the variability in height within each category. This design results in four combinations. We’ll ensure clarity in the plot by either separating violins with facetting or introducing one variable at a time This approach helps us in visualizing whether taller palms are more likely to produce larger or more conspicuous fruits, and helps reveal potential evolutionary or ecological strategies linked to display and dispersal.\n\n\nApproach for question 2\nFor the second question we are using heatmap to visualize combination of spine traits and growth forms. This allows us to investiage defensive traits such as spines (armature) co-occur with certain growth habits (climbing vs non-climbing). The approach is ideal for categorical co-occurrence data.\nWe begin with filtering and cleaning of the PlamTrait dataset thereby retaining only the relevant variables that is climbing, leaves_armed, and stem_armed. Any missing or ambiguous entries will be excluded. We will standardize the categorical values for consistency (armed vs unarmed) and create a new variable representing each unique trait combination such as both armed, leaf only, stem only, unarmed.\nWe will then group the data by climbing status and the combination variable. Using dplyr, we’ll calculate the count of palm species in each category combination.\n\nThe Heatmap will have “climbing” on one axis and the “spine combination categories” on the other. The fill color of each cell will reflect the “frequency or relative proportion of species” within that category pairing. We then annotate the tiles with exact counts to show visual interpretation better.\n\nHeat map visualization will help us identify whether climbing palms are more or less likely to exhibit defensive traits compared to erect palms. The heatmap’s clear structure makes it easy to detect trait co-occurrence patterns and generate hypotheses about the evolutionary or functional relationships between growth form and physical defenses."
